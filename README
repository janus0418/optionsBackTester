# Options Strategy Backtester

A modular Python framework for pricing, simulating, and analysing complex multi-leg option strategies with production-oriented structure.

## Features
- OOP design with pluggable pricing models (Black-Scholes, Bachelier, surface bump-and-revalue).
- Market data/vol surface abstraction with interpolation.
- Strategy and portfolio abstractions supporting common spreads and butterflies.
- Backtest engine computing P&L, Greeks, P&L attribution, and rolling metrics.
- Visualization helpers for P&L, drawdown, attribution, and risk profiles.
- Breakeven analysis scaffold.

## Quickstart
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or install key packages directly: `pip install numpy pandas scipy plotly pytest`.

2. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

3. Explore the API by composing market data, pricing models, strategies, and running `BacktestEngine`.

## Structure
- `backtester/data.py`: Market data and vol-surface containers.
- `backtester/instruments.py`: Option contracts, legs, strategies, and portfolios.
- `backtester/models.py`: Pricing model interface and implementations.
- `backtester/backtest.py`: Backtest engine and configuration.
- `backtester/metrics.py`: Performance metrics, P&L attribution, and breakeven analytics.
- `backtester/visualize.py`: Plotting utilities.
- `backtester/tests/`: Unit tests for pricing and metrics.

## Notes
- The framework is model-pluggable; extend `PricingModel` for advanced dynamics (e.g., Heston/SABR).
- Greeks attribution and breakevens leverage the same abstractions and can be tailored to your data.
